**LCD Game - World Changers** is a simulator of a never existed physical LCD handheld conversion of **[World Changers](https://github.com/kesiev/wc)**, an action game inspired by old classics, like Cabal, Contra, and OutRun, and modern games like Gears Of War and mobile casual gaming. In a way is a *demake* (of World Changers) *of a remake* (of Cabal, Contra, and OutRun) *of a demake* (of Gears Of War).

## Story

The world is not *right* and that's not good! Try to change it as it should be using the most effective tools humanity invented - according to *the best people* in history!

Take down enemy soldiers and huge tanks, collect diamonds and bring *peace* to Earth once and for all... or (most probably) die trying!

## Gameplay & Controls

   - Hit F or click/touch the game display to fullscreen the game
   - Use the arrow keys or click/touch the arrow controls to move your soldier
   - Hit Z or click/touch the FIRE button to fire
   - Hit X or click/touch the RELOAD button
     - Hit the RELOAD button again when the arrows are aligned with the top of the bar for a perfect reload!
   - Eliminate the required amount of enemies in time or... game over!
   - You can hide behind the walls on the bottom of the screen...
   - ...but enemies can do the same with the walls far from you!
   - Don't forget to collect the diamonds!

## Why? A Christmas story.

When I was a kid my father was a huge home computer fan and, when I asked for a gaming console, he used to answer *"Why do we need a console if we have a system that does more?"*. But there was a [SEGA Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis) (the SEGA Megadrive here in Italy) game I had seen at my friend's home that blew my mind and I was super-sure that would never be on our [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64): [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog).

I was so into that game that I kept stressing my parents about Sonic every week. One day, around Christmas, I managed to convince them to buy me _something to play Sonic_ that was cheap enough to _justify the purchase_ in some way. Unsurprisingly, It was the infamous [Tiger Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Electronics) adaptation of the game.

The game was _quite bad_: the crisp colorful graphics were gone, the sense of speed was missing, and the great music and sound effects were just bleeps and bloops... but still _I loved that game_. Maybe at that time, I had enough creativity to see the little traces of _Sonic_ that were in that game. Maybe I had learned to enjoy what I had without asking for more.

But now, as an adult, I've to admit that porting _anything of Sonic_ into a tiny LCD game has probably been a _desperate mission_ for the Tiger Electronics programmers and engineers.

So, this Christmas, I want to pay a little tribute to all those who try despite the limits, despite the results, and despite everything. I want to go down the _desperate_ creation process of injecting a little of another game into an LCD game - even if I'm well aware that's way easier to make a simulator in 2022 than the real thing in 1991. So I've chosen **World Changers**...

... and coding this game. It has been a nice trip! Thank you for reading this far and, if it suits for these days, Merry Christmas!
